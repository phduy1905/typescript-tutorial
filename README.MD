# TRAINING PROCESS

1. OOP

- Understand OOP structures: classes, objects, methods, properties.

  - Class: Blueprint for an individual object.
  - Object: Instance of a class created with defined data. Object can be related to real-world object.
  - Method: Functions defined inside a class.
  - Property: Pair of key-value inside a class.

- Understand OOP principles: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism
  - Encapsulation: By using private, protected access modifier, properties inside a class could not be modified from outside.
  - Abstraction: Abstract class and interface only define general properties or methods, sub-class will base on those rules to implement interface or extend abstract class.
  - Inheritance: Subclass extends the properties and methods of superclass.
  - Polymorphism: Methods and properties from one class might be different or return different result from other class, even though both two classes extends from same superclass.

2. Solid Principle

- Single responsibility principle: each class just handle one work
- Open / Close Principle: open for extending, close for modifying
- Liskov Substitution Principle: objects of subclasses should behave in the same way as objects of superclass.
- Interface Segregation Principle: Interface should be devided to be smaller and more specific
- Dependancy Inversion Principle: High-level module should not depend on low-level module. Both types should depend on abstraction.

3. TypeScript
